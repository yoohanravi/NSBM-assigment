                        <p>
                            There are 33 species of pinnipeds (meaning "wing-" or "fin-footed") which include 18 true seals, 
                            14 eared seals (sea lions and fur seals), and 1 walrus. California sea lions belong to the family 
                            Otariidae which means "little ears.” In the scientific community, there are many debates concerning 
                            the ancestry of eared and true seals. Some scientists believe that eared seals and walruses may 
                            have evolved 30 million years ago from bear-like creatures in the North Pacific, and that seals 
                            evolved from otter-like carnivores in the North Atlantic.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Seals vs. Sea Lions: Is there a difference?</h4>
                        <p>
                            Seals and sea lions have several visible differences. Sea lions have external ear flaps, whereas 
                            the majority of seals have a small opening for an ear and lack an external ear flap. A flexible 
                            pelvic girdle enables sea lions to move more easily on land by rotating their hind flippers 
                            underneath their bodies and walking like other four-legged animals. To move on land, seals propel 
                            their streamlined bodies in a way similar to a caterpillar. Both seals and sea lions are 
                            professionals in the water environment. Sea lions use their large front flippers to propel 
                            themselves through the water. Seals use their hind flippers in a side-to-side motion.
                        </p>
                        <h4>How fast can a sea lion swim?</h4>
                        <p>
                            Sea lions can swim in burst speeds up to 25 mph, but generally cruise at approximately 11 mph. Sea 
                            lions gain speed by porpoising, gliding on the water's surface to minimize resistance. Surfing in 
                            front of waves or large whales seems to be a fun activity for sea lions. Sea lions have often been 
                            called the “Angels of the Sea” due to the unique way that they swim. Sea lions will use their hind 
                            flippers to steer and swim using their front flippers. True seals usually swim at about 6 mph and 
                            can reach speeds as fast as 18 mph. Walruses tend to take a relaxing approach to the water, 
                            averaging speeds of 6 mph or less.
                        </p>
                        <h4>How long do sea lions live?</h4>
                        <p>
                            The average life span of a sea lion is around 20 years, although some have been recorded to live 
                            into their 30s. Age is determined by counting growth layers in their teeth, similar to counting 
                            rings in a tree trunk. Scientists have noticed that males tend to live shorter lives than females.    
                        </p>
                        <h4>What do sea lions eat?</h4>
                        <p>
                            Sea lions feed on a variety of organisms including various fish (anchovies, herring, salmon, 
                            rockfish, and hake), squid and octopus. Sea lions at Dolphin Research Center eat herring, smelt, 
                            and capelin. Wild sea lions often feed cooperatively, eating 5 - 8% of their body weight each day, 
                            which is between 15 - 35 pounds (7 - 16 kg) of food. Sea lions have 34 to 38 teeth, specially 
                            designed for grasping and tearing their food; however, their food is swallowed whole. Most of 
                            their water intake comes directly from the fish they eat, although they may occasionally drink 
                            small amounts of seawater while fasting throughout the breeding season. Rocks, sometimes found 
                            in the stomachs of sea lions, may create a false sensation of fullness during the fasting period.

                        <h4>Do sea lions have good senses?</h4>
                        <blockquote>
                        <p>
                            Hearing :- Sea lions hear both above and below the water's surface, although they hear better under 
                            water. Studies show sea lions can hear frequencies up to 70,000 Hz, but tend to vocalize within a 
                            range of 100 to 10,000 Hz. This is comparable to humans who have a hearing range of 20 to 20,000 
                            Hz. Sea lion vocalizations include barks, clicks, moans, chirps, growls, and squeaks. There is no 
                            concrete evidence to suggest that sea lions use echolocation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Sight :- Sea lions, like many marine mammals, can see well both above and below the surface 
                            of the water. Unlike humans, sea lions may not see in color. They can possibly discriminate colors 
                            in the blue - green spectrum. All pinnipeds have a membrane at the back of each eye called a 
                            tapetum lucidum to aid in night vision. Cats also have a tapetum lucidum, which is why the eyes 
                            of both cats and sea lions glow at night. On land, their eyes are protected by a nictitating 
                            membrane, which wipes away sand and debris.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Smell :- Sea lions cannot smell underwater but, above water, smell is a highly developed 
                            sense. Females use smell for pup recognition and males use it for breeding purposes to locate 
                            females in estrus.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Taste :- Sea lions have a limited sense of taste, similar to other marine mammals.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Touch :- Sea lions are tactile mammals. Their whiskers contain nerve fibers, which make them 
                            sensitive. They may use their whiskers to aid in navigation or to detect vibrations from prey in 
                            the water.
                        </p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <h4>How do sea lions sleep?</h4>
                        <p>
                            On land, sea lions will sleep in a variety of positions, often on top of their friends. 
                            California sea lions have been seen interacting with other species of pinnipeds, such as 
                            northern elephant seals, harbor seals, Northern fur seals, and Steller sea lions. In the 
                            water, they will sink to the bottom of shallow areas, and occasionally rise to the surface 
                            for air. In deeper water, they will float upright with the tip of their nose out of the water.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Breeding</h4>
                        <p>
                            Once a sea lion becomes sexually mature, at around age four or five, they are able to breed. 
                            Female sea lions are called cows, while males are called bulls. Those who live in Baja, California 
                            and southern California establish breeding territories from May through July. Cows congregate in 
                            closely packed, moderate to large groups. Bulls defend territories and fast during the breeding 
                            season.<br><br>
                            Males compete for dominance, leaving the younger males without a chance to mate for the season. 
                            One distinct characteristic of a full-grown breeding male is the presence of a sagittal crest, 
                            a raised forehead that appears at about 10 years of age. The dominant male will mate with an 
                            average of 16 females in one season. Once the egg is fertilized inside the female, she can delay 
                            implantation of the egg to stop the embryo from growing. The delayed implantation may last up to 
                            three months with an average gestation period lasting 9 months. Sea lions mate approximately 20 - 
                            30 days after the birth of their pup, leaving only about one month out of the entire year that she 
                            is not pregnant.<br><br>
                            In the Northern Hemisphere, pups tend to be born in mid-June. Each mother usually gives birth to 
                            a single pup. Twins are rare and mothers seldom adopt other pups. The pup nurses from the mother's 
                            four abdominal teats for about 6 - 12 months. The length of lactation increases with the increasing 
                            age of the female. Sea lion milk contains about 35% fat so the pups grow rapidly. Pups begin 
                            feeding on fish along with the mother's milk after about two months. Between nursings the mother 
                            returns to the sea and feeds for several days, leaving her pup on the mainland. Upon her return, 
                            she recognizes her pup on land through vocalizations and/or scent. Once the mating season is over, 
                            the males seasonally migrate long distances north while the females do not move beyond the 
                            Southern California Channel Islands. The males return to the breeding grounds from March to May.

                                <p>Lions are the kings of the jungles, but why are these marine mammals called Sea Lions..? Known as Muhudu Sinhaya in Sinhala, this strange name grabs the attention of the zoo visitors who flock to the arena at the entrance to the Aquarium to witness the performances of Chakku and Karl - Colombo Zoo’s pair of sea lions. They are very intelligent and play many tricks in front of you. It is amazing, how they so obediently act on their master's commands. Playing with the ball is their favourite game and they also like to swim the length of the small pond to show acrobatic skills. After the show, the sea lion would shake hands with the masters and say goodbye to the audience before they go into their dens, located inside.
