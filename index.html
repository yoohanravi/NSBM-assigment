                            <p>Lions are the kings of the jungles, but why are these marine mammals called Sea Lions..? Known as Muhudu Sinhaya in Sinhala, this strange name grabs the attention of the zoo visitors who flock to the arena at the entrance to the Aquarium to witness the performances of Chakku and Karl - Colombo Zooâ€™s pair of sea lions. They are very intelligent and play many tricks in front of you. It is amazing, how they so obediently act on their master's commands. Playing with the ball is their favourite game and they also like to swim the length of the small pond to show acrobatic skills. After the show, the sea lion would shake hands with the masters and say goodbye to the audience before they go into their dens, located inside.

                                As such, we ask that any guests or visitors who have visited or been in contact with anyone with COVID 19 postpone their booking or visit until at least 14 days post their contact.
                                
                                We also strongly request that any person displaying symptoms of COVID-19 refrain from visiting until obtaining a negative COVID-19 test.

                                Food service outlets will be operating with separate entry and exit points, and we encourage cashless transactions
                                Limits on the number of guests in indoor spaces will also be applied. Please be patient

                                A third entry point will be opened to spread out visitor arrivals
                                The animals and staff are excited to welcome back all visitors and ask that everyone assists us to maintain a safe environment for all by maintaining social distancing and good personal hygiene.

                                In line with the above, guests and visitors may be required to wear facemasks at certain times during a tour if close contact with an animal or guide occurs, or for some encounters with more vulnerable species such as meerkats and cheetahs. Where possible guests and visitors will be given a mask-free photo opportunity, at a safe distance on each tour and encounter. This will be at the guides/keeper's discretion.
