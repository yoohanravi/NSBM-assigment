                          <p>Lions are the kings of the jungles, but why are these marine mammals called Sea Lions..?
                               Known as Muhudu Sinhaya in Sinhala, this strange name grabs the attention of the zoo 
                               visitors who flock to the arena at the entrance to the Aquarium to witness the 
                               performances of Chakku and Karl - Colombo Zoo,s pair of sea lions. They are very 
                               intelligent and play many tricks in front of you. It is amazing, how they so 
                               obediently act on their master's commands. Playing with the ball is their
                                favourite game and they also like to swim the length of the small pond to
                                 show acrobatic skills. After the show, the sea lion would shake hands with 
                                 the masters and say goodbye to the audience before they go into their dens,
